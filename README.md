# Quantum Tech - Shaping a Quantum-Powered Tomorrow

This is a web project for showcasing a futuristic concept of quantum technology, highlighting the power of quantum computing and its potential for shaping the future.

## Project Overview

The "Quantum Tech" website is designed to provide users with an engaging and informative experience about quantum computing. The website features a modern, sleek design with a focus on clean user interface (UI) and responsive design. It includes a header, hero section, information about quantum technology, and a footer.

### Features:
- **Hero Section**: Background image with text that introduces the project and provides a call to action (CTA) button for user engagement.
- **Navigation Bar**: A dark-themed navigation bar with links to various sections of the site.
- **Footer Section**: Contact and legal links at the bottom of the page.
- **Mobile Responsive**: The design is mobile-friendly and adjusts based on screen size.
